Here, attempts to solve the problem of eliminating line breaks are implemented.
At the moment there are 3 programs.
1) The first simply uses the available morphological filters, which is why the result is not successful. By changing the size of the filter, you can change the fill area.
2) In the second program, the direction of the lines is already determined, along which the lines are then drawn on top, many defects appear.
3) in the third, directions are also determined, only instead of stupid line drawing, its own morphological filter is written that paints over areas opposite to the direction.
